<p>Termites are such destructive pests that you desire your termite treatment to result in termite extermination. When action, monitoring, and identification thresholds indicate that pest control is needed, and preventive techniques are no longer effective or offered, IPM programs then examine the correct control technique both for effectiveness and risk.

<p>For some jobs, pest control workers utilize a combination of pest management strategies, a practice called integrated pest management.

<p>IPM is utilized in agriculture, gardening, forestry, human habitations, preventive conservation and basic pest control, including structural pest management, turf pest management and decorative pest management. Treat a pest invasion with a hand sprayer, fertilize your lawn with a granular spreader, deal with termite treatments with a foamer, bait for roaches and ants with a professional bait weapon, or apply pre-emergent herbicides with a backpack sprayer.</p>
