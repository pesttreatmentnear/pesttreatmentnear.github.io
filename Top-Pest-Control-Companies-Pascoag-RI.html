<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical approaches such as cultural practices, usage of resistant ranges, proper irrigation and fertilization, and natural opponents.

<p>One ofthe biggest advantages of natural methods is that they do not involve making use of toxicchemicals.
