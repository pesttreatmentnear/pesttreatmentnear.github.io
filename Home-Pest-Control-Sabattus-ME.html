<p>Although multiple sources define IPM in different methods, previous designs mostly focused on the ecological, and to some extent on the evolutionary, elements of pest management (Peterson et al. 2018 ). A current IPM pyramid provided by Stenberg (2017) recognized an absence of a holistic IPM technique that utilizes both conventional and modern-day tools.</p>
<p>Early detection in most cases can help address the pest situation by affordable spot treatment or removal of pests or contaminated or plagued plant material. Novel methods such as silencing of pest gene or RNA disturbance (RNAi) and endosymbionts hosted by insect pests could be used as potential new tools for future management of insect pests.</p>
