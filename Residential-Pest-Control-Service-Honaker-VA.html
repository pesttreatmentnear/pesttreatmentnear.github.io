<p>Biological pest control steps make the most of the hierarchy within nature. IPM programmes preliminary task is to establish appropriate pest levels, called action thresholds, and apply controls where the limits are crossed. Understanding of these limits and dynamics of pests and natural opponents helps to avoid unneeded (chemical) interventions. Some termite control technicians even fix structural damage caused by termites.</p>
<p>It entirely eliminates termites unlike routine pest control that just repels them. 3The following premium pests are not included in the basic plan, but can be treated for a surcharge: fleas, ticks, carpenter ants, fire ants, pharaoh ants, tawny insane ants, black widow spiders, brown recluse spiders, and bees (yellow jackets, hornets, wasps). Sustainable growing requires crops to be resistant to diseases and problems, and the environment in which they are grown needs to have a capability to fix itself. </p>
<p>Kaolin particle movies used in organic farming may control some pests, but can adversely impact natural opponents and cause other pests to multiply (Markó et al. 2008 ). Organic farming practices might motivate natural enemy populations, but a greater variety of natural enemies does not always result in pest suppression (Dara 2014 ). Mechanical pest control practices such as vacuuming or tilling use nonrenewable fuel sources and indirectly have an unfavorable impact on the environment.</p>
