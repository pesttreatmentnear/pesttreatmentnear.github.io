Although the basic components of IPM are always the very same, the specific elements of an IPM program differ from one environment or scenario to another.

For example, pressures of predaceous mites, rove beetles, lacewings, and types of parasitoids have been chosen for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, thereby increasing the possibility that some will survive insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
<p>Other persistent and emerging pest issues include vectored animal and human illness such as West Nile infection, Eastern equine encephalitis and Lyme disease; plant pests and illness such as emerald ash borer and soybean rust; and more than 170 harmful aquatic, terrestrial or parasitic weeds continue to challenge pest managers in the U.S. and somewhere else, and need efficient pest management procedures.</p>
