In essence, the linking of IRM and IPM offers a management viewpoint that is the very same as long-lasting, areawide pest management (Elliott et al., 2008). A pest control company does not simply go straight to removing pests.</p>
<p>Organic food production is not pesticide-free and some of the pesticides used in a natural system are as damaging to human beings and nontarget organisms as some chemical pesticides.
