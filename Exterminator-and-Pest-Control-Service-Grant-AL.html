With IPM, you do something about it to keep pests from becoming a problem, such as by growing a healthy crop that can stand up to pest attacks, utilizing disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from entering a structure. Recent missions for reliable, safe, and lasting pest management programs have been targeted mainly toward advancement of new and better items with which to change traditional toxic pesticides.</p>
